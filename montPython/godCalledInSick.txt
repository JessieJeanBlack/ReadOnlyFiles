Let's admire the patterns forming. Murderous filagry. I'm caught in the twisting of the vines. Go ascend with ivy climbing. Ignore and leave for me, the headstones crumbling behind.

I can't help my laughter as she cries. My soul brings tears to angelic eyes. 

Let's amend the classic story; close it to beautifully. I let animosity unwind. Steal away the pages. Hidden so shamefully. 

And miles away my mother cries. Omnipotence nurturing malevolence! Hoooo!!!! ohhhh hoooo....

Whoa Ho!
